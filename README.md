toolbox


This is my GitHub project that will hold all my usual throwaway code.  For as long as I've been programming, I've always
created sample POCs for understanding the mechanics of a particular API or something.  I usually throw them away after I 
figure out what I need to do with them, but sometimes I need to revisit something and have to recreate my POCs again.

This project is meant to be my permanment "toolbox" of throwaway code.
